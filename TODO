FUTURE ITERATIONS:

Implement open() and close() of files.

Multiple clients

Clients in separate processes

Remote clients

Producer-consumer queue

address issue of stuff created on heap vs. stack

reassess use of assert()

check for functions that should be inline

check for functions that are too long

confusing naming of constants in aJTypes.h.     DONE

The changes below may have to
      wait until the next release!
Important: MemMan::blksInMem is a bitset<NUM_DISK_SECS>
           Replace with an array<bitset<>>
           Journal::blksInJrnl ditto!
           Memory::avlMemSlts is bitset<NUM_MEM_SLOTS>
           Does this need to be replaced also?
           Are there others?

When file open() close() are implemented, must maintain a counter (in page table?)
of how many times the file has been opened and not yet closed. Blocks not 
currently part of an open file *may* be removed from page table.

Try to remove excess 'using namespace xxx' from .h files

improve algorithm for this function after converting data member to ArrBit
// Returns index of first free memory slot, if any.
// Otherwise, returns NUM_MEM_SLOTS
uint32_t Memory::getFirstAvlMemSlt()
