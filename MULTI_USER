When there are multiple clients, a write lock will have to be implemented.

When multiple users access the same file, the first user to write gets the write 
lock. Once the user gives up the write lock, the lock MAY NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE 
TO ANY OTHER USER UNTIL THE NEXT JOURNAL PURGE.

Somehow, the changes made by the user with the lock must then be pushed to all 
other users who have the same file open.
